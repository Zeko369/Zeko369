## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<!--
I have 7+ years of backend/fullstack experience, most recently I've been enjoying next-blitz/trpc/graphql-prisma stack. 

*I'm currently on the hunt for a new fullstack/backend opportunity. Ideally I'm looking for dx/tooling/platform project/company.*

### Cool repos I worked on to checkout:
- [arc-sync](https://github.com/Zeko369/arc-sync) - my implementation of [Arc](https://arc.net/) mobile app that syncs with the desktop app via custom server
- [todo_app](https://github.com/Zeko369/todo_app) - next/graphql/prisma
- [chapter](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/chapter) - next/graphql/prisma(was typeORM)
- [auress_app](https://github.com/Zeko369/auress-app) - rn / expo
- [ical_filter](https://github.com/Zeko369/ical-filter) - serverless function to use as a proxy for a ical URL to filter events you don't care about
- [techtonic_hr](https://github.com/Zeko369/tectonichr) - university project with next/graphql/typeORM/chakra

### Chakra libs
- [chakra-next-link](https://github.com/Zeko369/chakra-next-link) - Merge NextLink and Link/Button/IconButton from chakra into one component
- [chakra-confirm](https://github.com/Zeko369/chakra-confirm) - async versions of window.confirm/prompt styled with chakra
- [chakra-form](https://github.com/Zeko369/chakra-form) - wrapper around react-hook-form + chakra components connected to RHF context form
- [chakra-data-table](https://github.com/Zeko369/chakra-data-table) - simplified table display with chakra (TODO: migrate this to tanstack-table)

### Fun:
- [g733-gnome](https://github.com/Zeko369/g733-gnome-shell) - util to read and display battery level of g733 as a gnome extension
- [ednevnik_scraper](https://github.com/Zeko369/ednevnik_scraper) - scrape exams from Croatian online grading system and put them in your google calendar

If you're solving AOC [here are my solutions](https://github.com/Zeko369/Advent-of-code-2022) from this year and a [WIP in rust](https://github.com/Zeko369/aoc-rust-2022)
